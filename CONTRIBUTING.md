## Getting Started

[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the repository onto your computer.

[Generate a github API access_token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with repo permissions (but generate a new key with more permissions if the situation calls for it) and put that key in `config.json`. Install node.js if you haven't already, then run the following commands in the project directory to get the app working locally on your machine:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will build the project and automatically start the development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You wil now have a running copy of the project on your local machine.

## Issues
