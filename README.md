# GitHub-Dashboard
A web based GitHub Dashboard for Seneca students working on Open Source Development.

This app tracks the user activities on GitHub and presents the statistics of the following:

- Issues
- Pull Requests
- Starred Repositories
- Forked Repositories

It also shows recommendations for future projects and bugs, the user can work on.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Installing

[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the repository onto your computer.

[Generate a github API access_token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with repo permissions (but generate a new key with more permissions if the situation calls for it) and put that key in `config.json`. Then run the following commands to get the app working locally on your machine:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will build the project and automatically start the development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
